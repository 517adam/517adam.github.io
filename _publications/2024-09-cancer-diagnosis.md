**Role:** Undergraduate Researcher, Supervised by Prof. Hao Chen (UROP)

**Description:**
* Conducted a comprehensive survey on deep learning methods for cancer diagnosis, synthesizing insights from over 10 seminal papers and recent benchmarks.
* Implemented and evaluated deep learning baselines, including MotCAT and MACT, to analyze performance gaps in cancer subtype classification.
* Identified key computational bottlenecks inherent in gigapixel resolution and high-dimensional feature spaces that limit traditional ML models.
